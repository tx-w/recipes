    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gyoza typically consist of a ground meat or vegetable filling wrapped into a thinly rolled piece of dough, which is then sealed by pressing the edges together.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped cabbage</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped carrot</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 package wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cabbage, onion, carrot, and garlic; cook and stir until cabbage is limp, 3 to 4 minutes. Add ground pork and egg; cook and stir until pork is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the gyoza: Place about 1 tablespoon pork mixture into the center of a wonton wrapper. Fold wrapper in half over filling, then seal the edges with moistened fingers. Repeat to make remaining gyoza.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook gyoza in the hot skillet until lightly browned, about 1 minute per side. Add water to the skillet, reduce the heat, cover, and steam gyoza until water is gone. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Mix soy sauce and rice vinegar together in a small bowl. Serve as a dipping sauce with gyoza.</li>
